# instructions for initial steps in creating a virtual environment
# (Hopefully only need to do this once)
cd ~/NREL_Projects/diffusion/python

# dump my current python versions to a txt file
conda list -e > conda_requirements.txt

# manually edit the txt file to delete things that don't seem to apply to dgen. 
# when uncertain if something is needed, keep it in. save changes.

# create the new environment using the requirements file
conda create --name dgen_pyenv --file conda_requirements.txt 

# activate the environment
source activate dgen_pyenv

# attempt to run spyder
spyder

# if error received, update spyder 
conda update spyder
# review and accept any changes, press y and enter (note: may need to have ssl verification turned off or be connected to developer vpn)

# try to run spyder again
spyder

# ideally, test the model within and outside of the environment to ensure results match

# if successful, export the environment to yml:
conda env export > environment.yml

# deactive the environment
source deactivate

# remove the virtual environment created from conda_requirements.txt
conda remove -n dgen_pyenv --all

# manually add in any pip packages to bottom of environment.yml
# recreate the virtual environment, this time from the yml file
conda env create -f environment.yml

# retest the model
