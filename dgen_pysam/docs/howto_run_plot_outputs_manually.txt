to run plot_outputs.R manually:

1) manually define the following variables in R:
- runpath = output folder to store the new graphics
- scen_name = name of the scenario
- tech = 'wind' or 'solar'
- schema = 'diffusion_wind' or 'diffusion_solar'

2) make sure pg_params.json is pointing to the right database

3) use setwd() to set the working directory in  the R session to ~/diffusion/r
